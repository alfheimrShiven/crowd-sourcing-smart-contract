# Getting Started ðŸš€

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`


## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-f23
cd foundry-fund-me-f23
forge build
```

## Deploy: 

```
forge script scripts/DeployFundMe.s.sol
```

## Testing

```
forge test
```

Only run test functions matching the specified regex pattern.

```
forge test --match-test testFunctionName
```

### Test Coverage

```
forge coverage
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

### 1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

### 2. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

### 3. Deploy 

#### TestNet deployment:

```
forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```


### Withdraw

```
cast send <FUNDME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "withdraw()"  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

### Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`


# Formatting


To run code formatting:
```
forge fmt
```
